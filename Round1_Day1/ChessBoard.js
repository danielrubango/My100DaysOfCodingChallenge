// Eloquent JavaScript : Exercice 3
// ChessBoard
/*
	Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines.
	At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character.
	The characters should form a chessboard.

	Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

	 # # # #
	# # # #
	 # # # #
	# # # #
	 # # # #
	# # # #
	 # # # #
	# # # #

	When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8
	and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
